<h2 id="codeReview">Code Review</h2>
<p>The code review covers the existing code for all three artifacts and the enhancements that will be completed for each one. The link below is a video which goes over the code in each artifact.</p>

<h2 id="art1">Artifact 1 Enhancement - Software Design and Engineering</h2>
The first artifact is the Treasure Hunt Game from the IT 140 class. The game consists of the user moving to different rooms to gather all the items to defect the zombie and was created in February of 2023. The artifact was selected to demonstrate successfully changing the programming language from Python to JavaScript and adding value by increasing the devices where the game can be implemented since JavaScript is integrated in many platforms including a web browser. 
I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by following industry standard practices or commenting each section of code on the actions the code will complete. I also added comments for each function that explains the required inputs and if the function returns a value, the comment explained what value would be returned when the function is called. Variable names were created that matched what their purpose would be as far as the value they will hold. Any variable definitions that were intended to the used globally in the functions were moved outside of the main method so they can be accessed easily within any of the functions. This also removes unnecessarily passing global variables between functions.
One item that was learned was structuring the code in the way the language would normally have the code setup and using the correct built-in modules to receive user input. Those were the only challenges which were easy to solve by making the correct updates.
